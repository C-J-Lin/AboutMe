# My Story, From High School Founder Till Now

Born in New York City, I grew up scattered across different places, caught in the crossfire of a turbulent marriage. My mom's mental illness cast a long shadow over my childhood, and I found myself at the center of an international custody battle that stretched between China and the United States. Adversity has a way of sharpening you. I learned early that no one was coming to save me, so I'd better save myself. Work ethic became my method.

In high school, I co-founded AutoCompanion, a B2B financial software platform for automotive deals, born from pure necessity. We weren't just building software; we were selling it, and selling cars with it. I jumped between roles: negotiating with JD Power, architecting the technical formulas that powered our platform, building our sales operation from zero to one. I built the CRM, designed the website, wrote the SOPs, recruited the team, trained them to quote deals. We were scrappy, and it worked.

Then NYU's Abu Dhabi program accepted me, a full-ride merit scholarship to join the 3% who make it in. That was a bizzare twist of fate. Supply chain shocks hit the automotive market hard. Revenue dropped over 20%. The founding team faced difficult choices. Our CEO brought on a childhood friend as full-time staff, and suddenly the calculus around my compensation and remote work from overseas didn't add up. I was given an involuntary exit at a generous valuation. I took it as my ticket to college.

But that startup left me one final gift. I'd sold a car to a VC general partner and his associate. They saw something: the hustle, the sales instinct, the entrepreneurial fire. They thought it might translate to venture capital. So when I landed in Abu Dhabi, halfway across the world from Pennsylvania, I joined 7BC Venture Capital. Over two years, I evaluated 50+ deep-tech investments across Web3, AI, quantum computing, and space. I led sector research on deals like Umbra, contributed to a $125M fund PPM anchored by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, and supported four investments and two exits.
My passion for automotive never died. I returned to it at BMW's Rolls-Royce Financial Services as an internal consultant, building Python and SQL pipelines to analyze VIN-level data and model subsidization strategies. Then came Golub Capital, one of the largest private credit funds in the world at $70B+ AUM, where I automated portfolio analysis workflows and built fund reporting infrastructure.
Now I'm finishing at NYU Stern with a 3.8 GPA, studying finance and economics, teaching MBA cases on defense and AI alongside Vice Dean Timmons.
And I'm building again. I'm working on a platform in the defense space, focused on geospatial satellite NITF image processing. Building off an open-source tool, I'm adding features that help align images for spatial intelligence analysis. From automotive software to venture capital to defense tech, the through line stays the same: find a problem, build the solution, make it work.
The kid from that custody battle learned something important: when the world won't give you stability, you build it yourself. One deal, one pitch, one line of code at a time.
