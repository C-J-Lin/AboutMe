# My Story, From High School Founder Till Now

Born in New York City, I grew up scattered across different places, caught in the crossfire of a turbulent marriage. My mom had a severe mental illness that cast a long shadow over my childhood, meaning I found myself at the center of an international custody battle that stretched between China and the United States. Adversity has a way of sharpening you. I learned early that no one was coming to save me, so I'd better save myself. Work ethic became my method.

In high school, I co-founded AutoCompanion, a B2B financial software platform for automotive deals, born from pure necessity. We weren't just building software; we were selling cars with it. I jumped between roles: negotiating with JD Power, architecting the technical formulas that powered our platform, and building our sales operation from zero to one. I built our CRM, designed the website, wrote the SOPs, recruited the team, and trained them to quote deals. We were scrappy, and it worked, going from a two-person team to five within a year, and from $5,000 to $100,000 in monthly sales. In hindsight, this was the most fun I ever had in my life. Waking up at 6 AM for school, juggling 100+ outbound calls and thousands of texts/emails per day was insane, and a rush I dearly miss. I sold thousands of cars during this time, and I still have life-long friendships with clients and suppliers, friends that I've couch-surfed or gone on vacation with.  

Then NYU's Abu Dhabi program accepted me, a full-ride merit scholarship to join the 3% who make it in, and more Oxford Rhodes Scholars per student than any other university on the planet. That was a bizarre twist of fate and a blessing. Supply chain shocks hit the automotive industry hard during that time. Our supply and revenue dropped over 20%. The founding team faced difficult choices. Our CEO brought on a childhood friend as full-time staff, and suddenly, the calculus around my compensation and remote work from overseas didn't add up. I was sadly given an involuntary exit at a generous valuation, and I took it as my ticket to college.

But that startup left me one final gift. During my time there, I had sold a car to a VC general partner and his associate. They saw something: the hustle, the sales instinct, the entrepreneurial fire. They thought it might translate to venture capital. So when I landed in Abu Dhabi, halfway across the world from Pennsylvania, a few months later I joined 7BC Venture Capital. The timing was perfect, the fund was pursuing a new Saudi Arabian-based fund, with a local partner, where we were planning to launch a fund and startup foundry/venture studio concept. Over two years, I evaluated over 50 deep-tech investments across deep-tech, including AI, quantum computing, and space. I led sector research on deals like Umbra, a company that's building a global satellite constellation, and contributed to a $125M fund PPM with a $125M match by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund under Saudi Vision 2030. The kid who grew up bouncing between Asia, America, and now the Middle East learned to spot people who build under pressure. At 7BC, I saw it in founders who reminded me of my 17-year-old self: the ones who didn't wait for perfect conditions, who built the thing they needed because no one else would. That pattern recognition, that instinct for who thrives in chaos versus who just talks about it, that's what I'm still chasing. I learnt to build and support founders, functioning as a force multiplier to founders, all while building out and getting responsibility to move forward with an ecosystem-building VC concept. 

Yet my passion for automotive never died. When school took me to New York at NYU Stern, I returned to it at BMW's Rolls-Royce Financial Services in New Jersey, as an internal consultant, building Python and SQL pipelines to analyze VIN-level data and model subsidization strategies. Then came Golub Capital, one of the largest private credit and private equity funds in the world at $70B+ AUM, where I automated portfolio analysis workflows and built fund reporting infrastructure.

Now I've finished school at NYU with a 3.8 GPA, studying finance and economics (with poli-sci and computer science qualifications), where I've been teaching MBA students about geopolitics and corporate strategy in the Middle East with NYU Stern's Vice Dean J. Timmons. I also wrote two capstone projects: a white paper where I intervieweded 20+ C-Suite executives about my other passion, aviation, and a second working paper utilizing AI/ML for creating financial models. And I'm building again, since leaving school. I'm working on a small project in the defense space, focused on geospatial satellite image processing, focused on a little known file type called NITF. Building off an open-source tool, I'm adding features that help align images for spatial intelligence analysis, a tool not found in commercially available software. From automotive software to venture capital to defense tech, the through line stays the same: find a problem, build the solution, make it work.

The kid who grew up in Pennsylvania learnt that when the world won't give you stability, you build it yourself. One deal, one conversation, and one line of code at a time.
